Project Statement: Foundational Inventory Management System

1. Problem Statement

Small retail environments require a systematic digital ledger to prevent inventory discrepancies and operational losses stemming from poor stock oversight. A simple, reliable tool is necessary for real-time stock visibility.

2. Scope of the Project

The project is a self-contained Command-Line Interface (CLI) application developed in Python 3.

Inclusions: Core inventory management (CRUD) and data persistence via local file handling (.json).

Exclusions: Graphical User Interface (GUI), network integration, and external database connectivity.

3. Target Users

Individuals managing daily stock in small retail settings: Small Business Owners, Retail Staff, and Inventory Managers.

4. High-Level Features

The application manages the product lifecycle with four core functions:

Record Management: Creation and permanent removal of product entries.

Stock Transaction Processing: Real-time, validated adjustments for incoming and outgoing stock quantities.

Data Inquiry: Instant lookups for current stock availability and recorded pricing.

Reporting: Generation of a complete, formatted list of all active inventory records.
